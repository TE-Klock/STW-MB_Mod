Mount&Blade Module System

For getting documentation and the latest version of the module system check out:

www.taleworlds.com/mb_module_system.html

For any user except myself:

In order to export the module correctly you'll need to change the export directory in "module_info" to an existing folder for you.
Then it should go in the module directory in your mount & blade warband folders.
